# ASTRON-128 Lab 1 & 2

Lab 1: Derived period-luminosity relations of RR Lyrae stars by applying Fourier analysis on raw light curve data from Gaia Data Release 3. We used MCMC methods to fit for the period luminosity relations of RR Lyrae stars and constructed an effective galactic dust map. 


Lab 2: We demonstrate a machine learning method employed by Ness et al. 2015 (The Cannon) to model stellar spectra without the direct calculations of synthetic spectra. Using the APOGEE (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment) spectral data and its corresponding labels from the ASPCAP/APOGEE pipeline, labels being atmospheric parameters of Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], we train a generative model to predict a spectrum given these atmospheric parameters. Using a training set and a test set of equal size of mostly red giant stars, the model is able to predict the labels given a spectrum to moderate accuracy.
